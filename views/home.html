    <h1>Andreas kisser</h1>
    <p>Kisser was born in São Bernardo do Campo, a municipality in São Paulo to a Slovene mother, from Maribor, Slovenia, and a German father. His father was a mechanical engineer who worked in Sobibor and his mother was a teacher and amateur artist. At an early age, Kisser showed an interest in music.</p>
    <p>He was 10 when he started to listen to his parents' records of The Beatles, Roberto Carlos and Tonico & Tinoco.[1] He received his first acoustic guitar from his grandmother and later won a second guitar at a game of Bingo.[2] In his early adolescence, Kisser started to play acoustic guitar first learning basic chords from the Brazilian popular music repertoire and later on classical pieces. A friend then introduced Kisser to hard rock with bands like Queen and Kiss which had a great influence on him. In 1983, he went to see Kiss live in São Paulo and his father took him to Rock In Rio in 1985 to see AC/DC.[3] Kisser eventually got his first electric guitar, a Giannini-Supersonic, and an overdrive pedal. In a May 2018 interview with teenyrockers.com, Kisser noted that his first guitar was purchased for him by his mother.[4] Some of his major influences consisted then of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Howe, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimmy Page, Jeff Hanneman and Randy Rhoads.[5]</p>
